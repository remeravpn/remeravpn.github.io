        <p> Jill Barham Secondary School was started 1994 by the Anglican Diocese of Cyangugu but because of the war in
          the same year, the structures were destroyed and the activities became on standstill up to 1995 when the work
          was restarted in September. The same year, the school opened with only secretarial option. The school was
          officially opened on 19th september 1998 by His Excellency the vice president Paul KAGAME.

          The school was built by the former bishop of Cyangugu Rt. Rev. KENNETH BARHAM when he saw the need of genocide
          survivors and wanted to create them employment through vocational training. That’s when he thought of
          secretarial studies as the best option for girls who wanted to take up government collar jobs as accounts
          secretaries.
          The name JILL BARHAM was named after the wife of Bishop Kenneth Barham, “Jill”.
